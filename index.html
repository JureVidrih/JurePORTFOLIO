                <h1>Hey. I'm Jure.</h1>
                <p>I'm a software developer from Europe and I have been programming for over 18 years.
                    Over the years, I have used different languages, libraries and frameworks
                    to build mobile apps, desktop apps and full-stack web apps. My interest currently
                    is in learning Angular and Java framework Spring alongside various dbs to create
                    full-stack web apps.

                        <h5>What is it?</h5>
                        <p>Busyn is an app/game engine built with web, mobile and desktop technologies such as React, React Native, Three.js and electron. It is my flagship project.
                            It allows its user to build desktop and mobile apps and games while leveraging libraries like React to build complete graphical user interfaces plus full 3D scenes (with React components!).
                            Besides offering the user various components for building GUIs, 3D scenes, managing physics and providing other utility components, it also gives full access to several systems, bundled
                            with the engine: StorageManager (for storing and retreiving data, with a uniform interface, whether you are building a mobile or a desktop app), UIManager, ThemeManager (for changing the look and feel
                            of the app on the fly), AIManager (useful for games) and more.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project's story</h5>
                        <p>Back in the late 2019, I started to work on what is now known as busyn-rn. Before that, I have used rnge in hopes of one day creating a mobile game. Over time, I realized
                            that I wanted to start from scratch and build a game engine that would follow a different architecture. I started to work on it and in some time, I have built a game engine
                            for mobile devices that could draw user interfaces, 3D objects and apply laws of physics to them. I have then worked for 2 years on the engine and in that time I have built
                            one game and one app using it. Then, in the late 2021, I wanted to try to port the engine to desktop, by replacing React Native with React and using Electron to package it all
                            as a desktop app. In a time span of about half an hour, I have succeded in porting an app built for mobile devices to desktop. I then categorized the electron version of the
                            engine as busyn-electron and mobile version as busyn-rn. And, since the project uses web technologies, a port for web called busyn-web might very well happen sometime in the future.
                            I should also note that the work on the mobile port stopped after I started to work on the desktop port, but I plan to backport changes to mobile sometime in the future.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Author's note</h5>
                        <p>This is my flagship project that I've worked on over the years. But, before I can deem the project ready of a 1.0 version release, there is still a lot of work to accomplish.
                            Also, I have been working on the engine over the years entirely by myself, which it makes a great undertaking for a single individual, considering its scope.

                        <h5>What is it?</h5>
                        <p>JureEVAL is a Java library that can evaluate arithmetical expression passed in as strings. It also supports common mathematical methods and even user-defined methods for doing calculations.
                            There really is no limit as to how deep and long these arithmetical expressions are, and JureEVAL supports storing results in variables and arrays that can then be used in further arithmetical expressions.

                            and the library can log messages into multiple end-points, as per the user's choice.
