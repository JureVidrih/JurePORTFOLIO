                <h1>Hey. I'm Jure.</h1>
                <p>I'm a software developer from Europe and I have been programming for over 18 years.
                    Over the years, I have used different languages, libraries and frameworks
                    to build mobile apps, desktop apps and full-stack web apps. My interest currently
                    is in learning Angular and Java framework Spring alongside various dbs to create
                    full-stack web apps.

                        <h5>What is it?</h5>
                        <p>busyn is an app/game engine built with technologies such as React, React Native, Three.js, cannon.js and electron that I have been working on&off since 2019. It is not in the finished state yet, but it is my flagship project.
                            It supports building of apps & games as desktop or mobile applications using React components for things like creating GUIs and 3D scenes with support for physics. It also comes with various systems for various needs, such as
                            storage, AI, async execution (and possible multi-threaded execution in the future with Web Workers API), convenient GUI theme management and toast messages support and more.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Project's story</h5>
                        <p>This project originally started of as a game engine for mobile devices, primarily using React Native and Three.js for building scenes with 3D objects. But, later on, I ported the engine to desktop by replacing React Native with React
                            and using electron to bundle the resulting web app as a desktop application. After that, I named the electron build busyn-electron and the React Native mobile build as busyn-rn. After that, however,
                            I continued to work only on the desktop version of the engine, and the original, mobile version was left unattended -- however, I plan to work on the mobile version sometime in the future.
                        </p>
                        <h5>About cross-platform porting</h5>
                        <p>I should also note, that I once ported an app that I've wrote for Android devices using this engine to a desktop platform in only, I believe, 30 minutes or so. Since both the mobile and the desktop version of the engine both use Javascript,
                            Three.js and technologies that are similar such as React and React Native, this wasn't a hard undertaking. And, since React Native uses flexbox for its GUI layout, the ported application's GUI on the desktop didn't look that broken either.
                            But, some additional work was needed.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Author's note</h5>
                        <p>It should be also noted, that building such a project is something of a massive undertaking for one single person and the project still needs a lot of work moving forward. Things like adding features that I want to be in the initial release,
                            fixing known bugs, testing features, improving performance, writing technical documentation, commenting and documenting the code are all tasks that still await me in the future.

                        <h5>What is it?</h5>
                        <p>JureEVAL is a Java library that can evaluate arithmetical expression passed in as strings. It also supports common mathematical methods and even user-defined methods for doing calculations.
                            There really is no limit as to how deep and long these arithmetical expressions are, and JureEVAL supports storing results in variables and arrays that can then be used in further arithmetical expressions.

                            and the library can log messages into multiple end-points, as per the user's choice.
